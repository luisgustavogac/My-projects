Hello visitor,

My name is Luis Campos, and I have spent the last two years working in supply chain planning.

I found it interesting at the time, but now I have discovered my true passion: programming and machine learning models.

Currently, my goal is to become a Data Scientist, and I am devoting all of my free time to dive into this field.

Here you can explore all of my projects and study files, be welcome!
